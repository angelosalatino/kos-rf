# Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS)

In the fields of *Physics* and *Astronomy*, we can find the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) developed by the American Institute of Physics (AIP). PACS was used by AIP and other international publishers, before being discontinued in 2010 and replaced in 2016 by the *Physics Subject Headings* (PhySH). 

PACS was released on an annual or bi-annual basis thanks to the support of the communities of researchers.
The last version contains around 8,200 subjects distributed over a five-level monohierarchic structure, and each subject is associated to a code.
At the first and second level there are generic subjects. 
At the top level, we can find ten broad categories, such as: *General* *00*, *The Physics of Elementary Particles and Fields* *10*, *Nuclear Physics* *20*, *Atomic and Molecular Physics* *30*, *Electromagnetism, Optics, Acoustics, Heat Transfer, Classical Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics* *40*, *Physics of Gases, Plasmas, and Electric Discharges* *50*, *Condensed Matter: Structural, Mechanical and Thermal Properties* *60*, *Condensed Matter: Electronic Structure, Electrical, Magnetic, and Optical Properties* *70*, *Interdisciplinary Physics and Related Areas of Science and Technology* *80*, *Geophysics, Astronomy, and Astrophysics* *90*. 


At the second level, we can find slightly more specific categories, such as: *General relativity and gravitation* *04* (under *General* *00*), *Atomic properties and interactions with photons* *32* (under *Atomic and Molecular Physics* *30*), and *Solid Earth physics* *91* (under *Geophysics, Astronomy, and Astrophysics* *90*).
At the third, fourth and fifth level, we can find the most detailed categories. At these levels, all codes consist of six alphanumeric characters with symbols ("+" or "-"), divided into three pairs.
Examples of third level codes are *Supergravity* *04.65.+e*,ss *Properties of atoms* *32.10.-f* and *Geomagnetism and paleomagnetism; geoelectricity* *91.25.-r*. The "-" or "+" as 5th character respectively denote presence or absence of 4th level. *In the examples, only the latter two codes (*32.10.-f* and *91.25.-r*) has a 4th level. 

For instance, *Ionisation potentials, electron affinities* *32.10.Hq* and *Rock and mineral magnetism* *91.25.F-* are subjects at the 4th level respectively under *Properties of atoms* *32.10.-f* and *Geomagnetism and paleomagnetism; geoelectricity* *91.25.-r*. As already mentioned, codes at the 4th level have similar structure to the ones at 3rd level, however, the semantic of symbols slightly changes. The "-" symbol or a lowercase letter as 6th character respectively denotes presence or absence of 5th level. In this case, only *91.25.F-* possesses a 5th level, e.g., *Environmental magnetism* *91.25.fd*, in which the 5th character is the same as for the 4th level code, but lowercase. 

This setup made the PACS hierarchy too rigid and extremely difficult to maintain. Some codes were repurposed over time and thus breaking backwards compatibility with already annotated documents. In addition, it was impossible to establish a polyhierarchic structure. All these issues led the American Institute of Physics (AIP) to discontinue PACS in 2010.
The 2010 version of PACS is available for browsing and download from a 2012 archived version of the AIP website (link below).
