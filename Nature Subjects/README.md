# Nature subjects

Nature subjects encompass a vast array of disciplines. They can be broadly categorised into life sciences and physical sciences.

In this folder there is an old ontology which was released in 2015. The Python notebook helps exploiring it.

Thene there is an excel with the most recent concepts, obtained thanks to the support of an ontology engineer at Springer Nature.
