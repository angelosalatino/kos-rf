# ACM Computing Classification System

In *Computer Science*, we can find the [ACM Computing Classification System](http://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012) (ACM-CCS), developed and maintained by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). 
This classification system is integrated within the ACM Digital Library, allowing users to search scientific records, such as papers, proceedings, magazines and so on. The current version dates back to 2012. 
Its maintenance is rather slow and expensive as this taxonomy is developed manually.
Indeed, its previous version dates back to 1998 and before that 1991, 1987, 1983 until and few others more until 1964, i.e., the date of first publication.

The current version of ACM-CCS contains around 2,100 topics, arranged in a six-level polyhierarchical structure.
It has 13 main roots: *General and reference*, *Hardware*, *Computer systems organisation*, *Networks*, *Software and its engineering*, *Theory of computation*, *Mathematics of computing*, *Information systems*, *Security and privacy*, *Human-centered computing*, *Computing methodologies*, *Applied computing*, *Social and professional topics*. However, it lacks both depth and breadth, and its releases quickly go out of date due to the rapidly changing nature of the research landscape.


The classification scheme can be browsed on the ACM website and can be downloaded in PDF and RDF (XML).
