# Mathematics Subject Classification

The [Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)](https://mathscinet.ams.org/msc/msc2020.html) is the main taxonomy used in the field of *Mathematics*. This scheme is maintained by [Mathematical Reviews](http://www.ams.org/mr-database) and [zbMATH](https://zbmath.org) and it is adopted by many mathematics journals including the [Applied Mathematics and Computation](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-mathematics-and-computation), [American Mathematical Society Journals](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/)journals), and ArXiv. The last version was released at the beginning of 2020 and typically a new official version is released every ten years. Indeed, the current revision replaced the 2010 [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://mathscinet.ams.org/msc/msc2010.html) or [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20200102160148/http://msc2010.org/msc2010final-Aug10.pdf).

MSC contains over 6K concepts distributed over three levels in a monohierarchic structure. It consists of 63 macro-areas (first level) classified with two digits, such as *Combinatorics* *05*, *Statistics* *62* and others. Each of these macro-areas is further refined into three- and five-digit classifications representing their sub-areas at the second and third level, respectively. For instance, *Parametric inference* *62F* at second level and *Parametric hypothesis testing* *62F03* at third level. For certain subjects, MSC may contain also information about related subjects in other sub-branches. For instance, *Fuzzy logic; logic of vagueness* *03B52* is related to *Logic in artificial intelligence* *68T27*, *Reasoning under uncertainty in the context of artificial intelligence* *68T37*, and *Fuzzy sets and logic (in connection with information, communication, or circuits theory)* *94D05*.
