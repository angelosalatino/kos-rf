# All Science Journal Classification Codes

The All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) codes is a multidisciplinary taxonomy of scientific areas adopted by Elsevier.

ASJC covers areas like *Life Science*, *Social Sciences \& Humanities*, *Physical Sciences*, and *Health Sciences*. It contains 334 fields and each of them is associated to a code. For instance, - *General Chemistry* is - *1600*, and - *Geology* is *1907*.

The ASJC is displayed as a flat list of fields, however by looking at the codes associated to the different subjects, we can implicitly infer a two-level taxonomic structure (monohierarchical). Indeed, more specific fields share part of the code with their generic area. For instance, - *Artificial Intelligence* - *1702* and - *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* - *1707* share the first two digit with their superarea - *General Computer Science*, which is - *1700*. Subject terms belonging to a similar area share the first two digits, then the most generic term takes "00" as last two digits, whereas more specialised fields get an incremental number.  

The full list of subjects is diplayed on a HTML page on the Elsevier website. Users need to parse the HTML page for downloading it.
