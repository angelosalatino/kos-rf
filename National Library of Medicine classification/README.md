# National Library of Medicine classification

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) classification is an indexing system in the field of *Medicine* and *Preclinical Sciences*, such as *Pharmacology*, *Microbiology and Immunology*, *Parasitology* and others. It has been developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the United States and it is mostly employed to index content in physical libraries. The National Library of Medicine releases two versions: winter and summer edition. 
The NLM classification contains around 4,761 unique concepts distributed over a four-layer monohierarchic structure.

This classification scheme is divided in the Preclinical Science section and the Medicine section. For the Preclinical Science section, at the top level we can find eight codes: *Human Anatomy* *QS*, *Physiology* *QT*, *Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Genetics* *QU*, *Pharmacology* *QV*, *Microbiology and Immunology* *QW*, *Parasitology, Disease Vectors* *QX*, *Clinical Laboratory Pathology* *QY*, *Pathology* *QZ*. For the Medicine section there are 27 top level codes, such as *General Medicine, Health Professions* *W*, *Public Health* *WA*, *Practice of Medicine* *WB*, *Communicable Diseases* *WC*, towards *History of Medicine, Medical Miscellany* *WZ*. These codes are further refined in sub-categories at second, third and fourth level. At those levels, codes are organised with numbers delimited by dots. An instance of second level code is *antisepsis* *WO 113*, while for a third level code we can find *cognitive neuroscience* *WL 103.4*. The fourth level expansion of the code is alphanumerical, as for *X-ray therapy* *WN 250.5.X7*.

The NLM classification is available for free in PDF and HTML format and can be browsed from the National Library of Medicine website.
