# Web of Science Categories

The Web of Science Categories is a controlled vocabulary of scientific areas, mainly used by Clarivate to categorise books and journals indexed within Web of Science (WOS). Its latest version dates back to January 2020.

The Web of Science Categories consists of a flat structure of 254 subjects covering several fields of the content indexed in WOS. For some fields, it does have coarse-grained subjects like *Sociology*, *Religion*, *Mechanics*; for some others it attempts a more fine-grained characterisation like for *Computer Science*, in which we can find *Artificial Intelligence*, *Cybernetics*, *Hardware \& Architecture*, *Information System*, *Interdisciplinary Applications*, *Software Engineering* and *Theory \& Methods*. 

All subjects within this thesaurus can be browsed on the Web of Science Categories page. Users that wish to download it need to parse the HTML page.
