# U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Library Classification System 

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Library Classification System is a taxonomy in the field of *Geology*, currently used for classifying and retrieving Geoscience materials from the [U.S. Geological Survey Library](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/usgs-library). Since the 1904, it has been curated by the U.S. Geological Survey to meet the changes and the increased specialisation of the *Earth Science* discipline. New versions of the USGS Library Classification System are published within the U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin, and its last update dates back to the 2000.

This taxonomy contains more than 2K subjects,  arranged in a seven-level monohierarchical structure, and each subject is associated to a code.
The USGS assigned codes to subjects following the same strategy of the *Dewey Decimal Classification*. Indeed, the reason why it was initially developed, back in 1904, is because Dewey Decimal system for Geoscience material was not sufficiently developed to appropriately classify the range of artefacts collected at the USGS Library. Also the *Library of Congress Classification System* had not been published, yet.

The taxonomy is organised in sections, which group together subjects that are conceptually close, such as *General Works* subjects have codes ranging within *001-095*, *Mineralogy and Petrology* *101-190*, *General, Structural, and Dynamic Geology* *201-298*, *Historical Geology* *302-371*, *Mineral Resources, Mineral Industries, and Economic Geology* *401-497*, *Geomorphology, Physical Geography, and Physiography* *500-590*, *Paleontology* *601-699* which is one of the sections extending onto six levels (see *Foraminifera* *617*), *Mathematics, Astronomy, Engineering, and Surveying* *701-799*, *Physics and Chemistry* *801-896*, *Biology* *901-999*. 

However, these roughly thousand codes do not sufficiently cover all aspects of Geology. To this end, specialised concepts get assigned a code that is punctuated after the third digit, like *Carbonates* *126.1*.

The USGS taxonomy can be browsed from the U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin (available in the repo).
