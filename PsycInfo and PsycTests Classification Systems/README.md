# PsycInfo and PsycTests Classification Systems

Original names: [APA PsycInfo Classification Categories and Codes](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/training/class-codes) and [APA PsycTests Classification System](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/training/psyctests-class-codes)

PsycInfo and PsycTests are two classification systems within the field of *Psychology*, developed by the [American Psycological Association](https://www.apa.org) (APA) to describe the content of the APA PsycInfo database.

The two schemes have a total of 188 concepts with PsycInfo consisting of 157 concepts and PsycTests of 31. Both PsycInfo and PsycTests associate a 4-digit code to each concept, allowing the user to unambiguously locate those concept within the three-layer hierarchical structure.
%These codes drive also the 3-level structure of the taxonomy. 
The first two digits in each four-digit number identifies the root or discipline. For example, *Health \& Mental Health Treatment \& Prevention* ***33**00*. The third digit in each four-digit number indicates the focus area, such as *Rehabilitation* *33**8**0*.  The fourth digit in each four-digit number identifies the topic, like *Drug \& Alcohol Rehabilitation* *338**3***.

Although, PsycInfo and PsycTests have been developed following the same principles, only PsycInfo is a taxonomy. PsycTests is rather a thesaurus as all its codes identify a root term pattern *XX00*. For instance, *Anxiety and Depression* *5100*, *Aptitude and Achievement* *5200*. 


Both classification schemes can be browsed either from the main website or their printer-friendly version on PDF. APA owns all copyright rights of both PsycInfo and PsycTests Classification Systems.
