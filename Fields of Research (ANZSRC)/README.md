# Field of Research (ANZSRC)

ANZSRC 2020 has been jointly developed by the ABS, Stats NZ, the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), and replaces ANZSRC 2008.

As part of this review process and development of ANZSRC 2020, many academic and research professionals, research organisations, government agencies, professional associations and peak industry bodies across Australia and New Zealand were consulted. Targeted consultation was also conducted with Indigenous discipline experts and peak bodies. The ABS gratefully acknowledges the assistance provided by these individuals and organisations.

FoR codes are part of The Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) system, which was designed to measure and analyse research and development statistics in Australia and New Zealand.

FoR codes categorise research activity according to the field in which research is undertaken and based on the processes and techniques used in the research and development. They are organised into a hierarchical structure:

    Division (2-digit)
    Group (4-digit)
    Field (6-digit).
