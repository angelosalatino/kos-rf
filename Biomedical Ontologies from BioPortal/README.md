# Biomedical Ontologies from BioPortal

Biomedical Ontologies from [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org) features several ontologies in the field of *Biology and Biomedicine*. The BioPortal is maintained by the National Centers for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) with the goal of enabling researchers in accessing, reviewing, and integrating disparate ontological resources, in all aspects of biomedical investigation and clinical practice.

The portal collects more than 1K different ontologies, that collectively include more than 13M distinct concepts. Downloading and processing all the ontologies was unfeasible and thus we could not compute the maximum depth.


One of the main strengths is that there exists an active community of practitioners who contribute in adding new mappings between ontology terms, hence collaborating towards one giant ontology capable of describing the whole field from different perspectives.
Indeed, at the time of writing, there are more than 55M links interconnecting those ontologies. 

As a proof of how ontologies are well integrated in this portal, the *Medical Subject Headings*, an ontology in the field of *Medicine*, is mapped to other 753 ontologies with more that 890K links. 

Among the several ontologies available within the BioPortal, it worth to mention some of them falling within the scope of this survey, such as *Bioscientific data analysis ontology*, *Medical Subject Headings*, *Radiation Oncology Ontology*, and *Computational Neuroscience Ontology*.
All ontologies deposited in BioPortal are independently developed by the different research groups. Because of this, they tend to be different from each other under different perspectives. For instance, some of them get weekly updates (e.g., [*Experimental Conditions Ontology*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/XCO)), some others are updated less frequently such as *MeSH*, which is updated twice a year.

They are different also with regard to the number of entities and the richness of their semantic relationships. Some ontologies are relatively small in both entities and relationships (e.g., [*Ontology of Liver for Radiology*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ONLIRA) with 56 classes) and very large ones such as [*The Drug Ontology*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DRON), with more than 500K classes.

Also, they are distributed with different formats and also with different licenses.
Some ontologies are released just in RDF/TTL, some others are released in OWL, CSV, RDF/XML or OBO format. 
Registered users automatically receive an API-Key for programmatic access all ontologies and classes.

With regard to licenses, some of them are freely accessible (e.g., [*MeSH*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MESH), [*EDAM*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM)), some others are available via custom licence (e.g., [*MedDRA*](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MedDRA)).
