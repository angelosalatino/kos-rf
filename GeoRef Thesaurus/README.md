# GeoRef Thesaurus

The [GeoRef Thesaurus](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304035445/https://www.americangeosciences.org/information/georef/thesaurus/lists) is a taxonomy in the field of *Geology* that is currently maintained by the American Geoscience Institute. It is employed to index the content of the [GeoRef database](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/georef), covering geoscience literature published worldwide. 

The GeoRef thesaurus consists of seventeen lists, each of them associated to an alphabetical letter from *A* to *R*, categorising the  whole field of *Geology* into subfields. In some cases, these lists are structured hierarchically, whereas in some other cases the list reports the various terms in alphabetical order. These lists report *fossils* *F*, *meteorites* *G*, *igneous*, *sedimentary* and *metamorphic rocks* respectively *H*, *I* and *J*. Next, *minerals* *L*, *soils* *M* and *sediments* *N*. GeoRef thesaurus contains also *geographic names* *O*, allowing digital libraries to be indexes according to the different geographical areas of analysis.

All in all, within GeoRef thesaurus we can find more than 30K concepts and the hierarchical lists go as deep as five levels.

The full list of subject terms can browsed either from the [PDF lists](https://www.americangeosciences.org/information/georef/thesaurus/lists) or from the [GeoRef database](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/georef/pages/subject_terms).
