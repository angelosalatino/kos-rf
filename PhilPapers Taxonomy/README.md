# PhilPapers Taxonomy

The [PhilPapers Taxonomy](https://philpapers.org/help/categorization.html) is a classification scheme in the field of *Philosophy* developed by the [PhilPapers Foundation](https://philpapers.org/foundation). It is used to index content within the PhilPapers database, which is a comprehensive index and bibliography database of the field.

The taxonomy is a work in progress and it is continuously updated. At the time of writing, it contains 7447 subjects distributed over a five-level polyhierarchical system.

At the first level, the PhilPaper taxonomy hierarchy is structured in seven *clusters*: *Metaphysics and Epistemology*, *Value Theory*, *Science Logic and Mathematics*, *History of Western Philosophy*, *Philosophical Traditions*, *Philosophy Miscellaneous*, and *Other Academic Areas*. At the second level, these clusters are then divided into *areas*, such as *Philosophy of Language*, *Philosophy of Mind*, and *Philosophy of Religion*. At the third level, we can find *subareas*, which are then subdivided into *topics* at fourth level and finally into *sub-topics* at the fifth level.
