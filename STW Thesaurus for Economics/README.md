# STW Thesaurus for Economics


In the field of *Economics*, we can find the [STW Thesaurus for Economics](http://zbw.eu/stw/version/latest) developed by [ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for Economics](https://www.zbw.eu). It is used to classify journals, working papers and conferences indexed in [Econbiz](https://www.econbiz.de). 

STW contains around 14K concepts over 13 levels in a polyhierarchic structure. 

At the top level, we can find 7 macro categories, each of them identified with a letter code, such as *Economics* *V*, *Business economics* *B*, *Economic sectors* *W*, *Commodities* *P*, *Related subject areas* *N*, *Geographic names* *G*, and *General descriptors* *A*. 

Each macro-category is further refined in sub-categories at second, third and fourth level. As observed in JEL classification and other schemes, also STW codes at lower level retain higher level codes and expand them. Each new level adds two numbers and they are delimited by a dot. For instance, an example of branch under the category of *Economics* *V* is *Development economics* *V.08* (second level), *Development policy and aid* *V.08.03* (third level), *Sociopolitical development* *V.08.03.02* (fourth level).

The STW thesaurus describes its concepts according to a number of existing ontologies, such as SKOS and RDFS. 
In particular, a concept is described with either a label (*rdfs:label*) or a preferred label (*skos:prefLabel*) when there are alternative labels (*skos:altLabel*) both in English and German.
A concept may also be described with broader (*skos:broader*) and narrower concepts (*skos:narrower*) and also related concepts (*skos:related*).

STW categories are also mapped to other external ontologies such as: *Wikidata*, *DBpedia*, *EuroVoc*, *TheSoz*, *Agrovoc*, *WKD-ARBR*, *JEL classification*, *SDMX subject-matter domains*, and *German National Library controlled keyword system*.
